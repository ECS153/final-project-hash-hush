- For everyone in the group include one sentence on each of these (1) what you did last week (2) what you plan to do this week (3) anything that youâ€™re stuck on. Also include links to any PRs you committed or design docs you wrote.

# Milestone 1
## Wenxuan Zhao
### What I did
1. Learnt HashCat and figured out how to integrate password generation tools with Hashcat
2. Found the state-of-the-art guessing generation tools: NN, Markov, and PCFG
3. Read the original PCFG paper 
4. implement the pcfg pre_terminal training step
5. make the milestone 1 [video](https://youtu.be/iwor-xvDkFM)

### Plan
1. Learn the PCFG implementation and figure out how to improve upon it.

2. Found the state-of-the-art guessing generation tools: NN, Markov, and PCFG.
3. Read the original PCFG paper
4. Collect the thoundsands of popular passwords, and collect the leaked database.

### Plan
1. Learn how to implement RNN and start to rebuild and improve the existing password guessing.



# Milestone 2
## Zuang Yu
### What I did
1. Learn RNN concepts and how to build it.
2. Learn Markov model for password guessing and compare Markov model with RNN model.
3. Understand and improve existing RNN model.
4. Make a video for weekly project meeting.

### Plan
1. Continue improving RNN and figure out how to improve its efficiency.
