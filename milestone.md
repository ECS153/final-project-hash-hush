# Milestone 1
## Wenxuan Zhao
### What I did
1. Learnt HashCat and figured out how to integrate password generation tools with Hashcat
2. Found the state-of-the-art guessing generation tools: NN, Markov, and PCFG
3. Read the original PCFG paper 
4. implement the pcfg pre_terminal training step
5. make the milestone 1 [video](https://youtu.be/iwor-xvDkFM)
