# 5.1 meeting: Project Idea

## Password Security
- Fundmentally, PWs are sometimes breakable because they are chosen by human with bias: pws are not uniformly distributed among the potential pw space
1. Attacks 
    1. on-line attack
        -  < 100 tries
        - PII (personal identifiable info)
        - sister pw
    2. off-line attack
        - brute force attack (a smarter one?)
        - dictionary attack: different ways to form dictionaries 
            - word mangling rules 
            - PCFG
            
        - hybrid (brute force + dictionary)
        - Neural Network


2. Defense 
    1. help users develop stronger and more usable pws 

3. Measurement
    1. people's pw habits 
        - in different scenarios 
        - across groups
    - we can then use the measurement results to build more powerful dictionaries that target a specific group/scenario

4. Theory 
    1. PW strength meter
