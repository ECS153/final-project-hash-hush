# Project Proposal 

- Password, specifically human-chosen text password, has been the principled and the dominant way to authenticate users. Despite the theoretically huge password space specified by the character sets and password length requirements, the real password distribution is far from uniform and therefore is vulnerable to the guessing attack. To make matter worse, the so-called offline attack, in which attackers try to break hashed passwords obtained from various leaked password databases offline, gives attackers the chance to utilize unbounded computing resources and time to find out the corresponding passwords.   

- To measure text passwords' resistence to the offline attack, we propose to incorporate the most state of the art adversarial password guessing techniques, such as Probabilistic Context-Free Grammer, Neural Network, and Markov Models, into the existing popular password cracking tools, such as HashCat and John the Ripper. In order to compare the performance of those techniques, we test them on the Have I Been Pawned database, one of the largest public available hashed real-world password corpuses, to see how many hashes can be recovered in a given amount of guesses. In this way, we are able to model the realistic adversarial efforts. Moreover, we plan to improve those techniques by trying out different variations to get the mot accurate result.
